## AML/CTF consent
By accepting these terms and conditions you give consent for STAX Trade App to disclose  
&nbsp;  
your name, residential address and date of birth to a credit reporting agency and ask the credit
reporting agency to provide an assessment of whether the personal information so provided
matches (in whole or in part) personal information contained in a credit information file in the
possession or control of the credit reporting agency to assist in verifying your identity for the
purposes of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act 2006. The credit reporting
agency may prepare and provide STAX Trade App with such an assessment and may use  
&nbsp;  
your personal information including the names, residential addresses and dates of birth
contained in credit information files of you and other individuals for the purposes of preparing
such an assessment. If you disagree with having your identity verified by a credit reporting
agency, please do not check the consent box or contact STAX Trade App so that we can
discuss other options with you.
